Description: This package provides functions to perform multivariate Gaussian parameter estimation based on data with abundance-dependent missingness. It implements a penalized Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The package is tailored for but not limited to proteomics data applications, in which a large proportion of the data are often missing-not-at-random with lower values (or absolute values) more likely to be missing.
